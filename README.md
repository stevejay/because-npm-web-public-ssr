# Because NPM - Server Side Rendering Version

This is the SSR version of the [because-npm-web-public](https://github.com/stevejay/because-npm-web-public) app.

## TODO

- CSS might not always be loading properly when navigating on the client
- Stable locality
- Social media meta data: https://moz.com/blog/meta-data-templates-123
- Is `@babel/polyfill` required?
